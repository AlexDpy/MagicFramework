# TASK: Please code a small PHP Framework on your own with the following requirements: 

* File based configuration for a Router component that can interpret parameterized routes e.g. /blog/{year}/{month}/{day} with default values and regex based type definitions like \d+ 

* Based on the route configuration a controller should be invoked with a defined action and the related route params are passed as arguments 

* The output of your controllers should be rendered by a template engine. You can decide which one to use. 

* Write unit tests for your components 

* Prepare a webserver configuration to be able to server the application 

* Create a handover document which describes how the application can be used in the browser and how the tests can be executed 

 

# GOALS: We want to see your basic OOP understanding, code style and the way of solving problems.
